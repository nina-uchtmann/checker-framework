LLM Support — Failures
Switched LLM models multiple times. 
Thought it was best to revert to original state two times, because of the overdone amount of edits to multiple files.
Initially produced duplicate diagnostics because the visitor still delegated to super after reporting BitPattern errors.
Some early explanations assumed incorrect interaction between BaseTypeVisitor and framework diagnostics.
Needed to provided snip bits of text from the manual to correct assumptions.
The model occasionally overexplained instead of providing concise diffs.
